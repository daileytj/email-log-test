##Situation:
We are an email hosting company. Our customer calls the customer support claiming some if his emails (incoming or outgoing) were not delivered.

##Tasks:
Design a simple tool/page that a person on customer support would use to search data in the email log (log sample attached for you to see what informations are logged by the email server)

Code the tool/page using dummy data

Create a skin of that page using CSS preprocessor

##Intentions:
Find the simple way to show useful information (as the log contains more than necessary) - we want to be able to proof what happened with any particular email quickly as we have the customer on the phone

Design basic elements for displaying the informations to the user

Describe any trade-offs faced and decisions made while designing the tool/page

Implement elements/styles/javascripts the way they can be reused (in case some other functionality regarding emails needs to be added later... for example displaying the content of the email)

Use advanced elements (interactivity, animations etc.) when it helps the user
